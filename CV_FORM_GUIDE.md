- ❌ "Responsible for team management"
- ❌ "Helped with performance improvements"

### ATS Optimization

1. **Use Keywords**: Match job description terminology
2. **Quantify Achievements**: Include numbers and percentages
3. **Action Verbs**: Start bullets with strong verbs
4. **Standard Formatting**: The form ensures ATS-friendly output
5. **No Special Characters**: Avoid emojis, fancy symbols

### Character Counts

- **Job Responsibilities**: 80-150 characters per bullet

✅ Good: "Angular, React, Vue.js, TypeScript, JavaScript"
❌ Bad: List each separately in 5 different rows
```
